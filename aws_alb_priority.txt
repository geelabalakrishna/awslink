Make sure your Listener Rules each have a unique "priority"
See the prior section understand what Listener Rules are.

When defining a Listener Rule, you must specify both a priority and a path. The priority tells the ALB in what priority a particular Listener Rule should be evaluated. For example, suppose you have the following Listener Rules defined on your ALB:

Route /foo traffic to Target Group ServiceFoo
Route /foo* traffic to Target Group ServiceBar
To which Target Group should a request for /foo be routed? Based on the above, it's non-determinate. For this reason, you must include a "priority" in the Listener Rule. A priority is an integer value where the lower the number the higher the priority. For example, if we add in priorities to our Listener Rules:

Priority: 100. Route /foo traffic to Target Group ServiceFoo
Priority: 200. Route /foo* traffic to Target Group ServiceBar
Now we know that the first Listener Rule has a higher priority. That means that requests for /foo will be routed to ServiceFoo, while all other requests will be routed to ServiceBar.

The gotcha here is that, because you define the Listener Rules for a single Listener across potentially many different ECS Services or Auto Scaling Groups, take care to make sure that each Listener Rule uses a globally unique priority number.

Note that in most cases, your path definitions should be mutually exclusive and the actual priority value won't matter.
